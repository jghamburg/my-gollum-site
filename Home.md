# Documenting Ideas using Gollum  

For some time I was looking for an easy way to write articles by using Markdown and / or Ascii doctor.  This experiment started with the web framework / wiki Gollum. Based on GitHub markdown and using git as persistance layer for me the horizonts opend up for writting longer 
technical articles with the safety of multiple revisions.

A good headstart on Gollum inside Docker you an find [here][docker-gollum].  

Best site for DevOps and Jenkins CD inspration I took from [Victor Farcic][vfarcic]. Look on [leanpub.com][leanpub]
