#2021-01-29 - Books I enjoyed to Read  

* [DDD Referenz (german)](https://leanpub.com/ddd-referenz) - translated by Eberhard Wolff (free version)
* [Eventstorming](https://leanpub.com/introducing_eventstorming) by Alberto Brandolini (Inventor of this Method)
* [Get Your Hands Dirty on Clean Architecture](https://leanpub.com/get-your-hands-dirty-on-clean-architecture), A Hands-on Guide to Creating Clean Web Applications with Code Examples in Java by Tom Hombergs 
 
In my optinion interesting for all Java/Springboot developers that are not happy with the layer based examples from Pivotal tutorials (Layered Architecture). In this book the hexagonal architecture is introduced and explained with a spring boot example on Github. - Benefits I see: clear modularization, good test coverage because of clear separation.
* [Microservices - A Practical Guide](https://leanpub.com/practical-microservices) - Principles, Concepts, and Recipes by Eberhard Wolff

A great curve ball touching all topics interessting on the subject of microservices. With good explanations.
* [Hands-on Domain-driven Design](https://leanpub.com/ddd-by-example) - by example, by Michael Pl√∂d

Domain-driven Design practically explained with a massive case study. - A practical and healthy view on the usage of the methodology and posibilities of DDD.
* [Secure by Design](https://www.manning.com/books/secure-by-design) by Dan Bergh Johnsson, Daniel Deogun, Daniel Sawano
 
Great examples and motivation why security is not just a feature but a basic way of thinking and developing software. Very practical and down to earth examples - ready to be used. I had a few interesting aha momends while reading this book: Oh I used to write exactly the same way as described in a few catastrophic examples from the authors.
* [Writing Great Specifications - Using Specification by Example and Gherkin](https://www.manning.com/books/writing-great-specifications) by Kamil Nicieja

How can I describe my requirements with good examples? How do I structure my ever growing test suite? And how can I structure my test suites to meet my concerns based on DDD?  
A lot of answers I found in this book.
* [Java Testing with Spock](https://www.manning.com/books/java-testing-with-spock) by Konstantinos Kapelonis

There should be no other testing framework besides Junit and Mockito? Wrong! Development is about choice and the right tool for the right problem. For this look into a BDD framework from the Groovy universe.  
- Personally I prefere [Spock framework](http://spockframework.org) over my old friend Junit. But I enjoy going for a drink with both.
