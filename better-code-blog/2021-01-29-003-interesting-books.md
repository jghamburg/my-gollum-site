# Books I enjoyed to Read  

First writeup on 2020-05-19.  

This is a short intro to books I really enjoyed and which made an impression on my knowledge landscape.

In my experience it is very important to learn new techniques and ideas by understanding the motivation and the needs of the authors at the time of creation.  
    There is no such thing like a silver bullet. - Old but true.

    „It is also important to me that you should always be driven by the following guiding principle when working with Domain-driven Design and when designing your software:
    The domain should be the heart of a system.
    Unfortunately, I experience it again and again that some so-called Domain-driven Design disciples propagate that real Domain-driven Design can only be pursued if you solve any requirement with the patterns of the Internal Building Blocks (Entity, Aggregate, ..). I consider this attitude to be fundamentally wrong and even harmful. In my opinion, it is crucial that you understand a requirement and its underlying business problem and then develop a solution that best reflects the domain model and the corresponding business domain. If the Internal Building Blocks patterns help you with that, then that’s excellent. I think the patterns are good but do they solve any problem? Certainly not. In my opinion you captured the essence of Domain-driven Design if you realize in such a situation that the patterns of Internal Building Blocks do not fit and instead choose another way.
    Although it is, of course, desirable when you manage to incorporate as many aspects of Domain-driven Design as[…]"
        Citation from: Michael Plöd. „Hands-on Domain-driven Design - by example."


* [DDD Referenz (german)](https://leanpub.com/ddd-referenz) - translated by Eberhard Wolff (free version)
* [Eventstorming](https://leanpub.com/introducing_eventstorming) by Alberto Brandolini (Inventor of this Method)
* [Get Your Hands Dirty on Clean Architecture](https://leanpub.com/get-your-hands-dirty-on-clean-architecture), A Hands-on Guide to Creating Clean Web Applications with Code Examples in Java by Tom Hombergs 
 
    In my optinion interesting for all Java/Springboot developers that are not happy with the layer based examples from Pivotal tutorials (Layered Architecture). In this book the hexagonal architecture is introduced and explained with a spring boot example on Github. - Benefits I see: clear modularization, good test coverage because of clear separation.
* [Microservices - A Practical Guide](https://leanpub.com/practical-microservices) - Principles, Concepts, and Recipes by Eberhard Wolff

    A great curve ball touching all topics interessting on the subject of microservices. With good explanations.
* [Hands-on Domain-driven Design](https://leanpub.com/ddd-by-example) - by example, by Michael Plöd

    Domain-driven Design practically explained with a massive case study. - A practical and healthy view on the usage of the methodology and posibilities of DDD.
* [Secure by Design](https://www.manning.com/books/secure-by-design) by Dan Bergh Johnsson, Daniel Deogun, Daniel Sawano
 
    Great examples and motivation why security is not just a feature but a basic way of thinking and developing software. Very practical and down to earth examples - ready to be used. I had a few interesting aha momends while reading this book: Oh I used to write exactly the same way as described in a few catastrophic examples from the authors.
* [Writing Great Specifications - Using Specification by Example and Gherkin](https://www.manning.com/books/writing-great-specifications) by Kamil Nicieja

    How can I describe my requirements with good examples? How do I structure my ever growing test suite? And how can I structure my test suites to meet my concerns based on DDD?  
A lot of answers I found in this book.
* [Java Testing with Spock](https://www.manning.com/books/java-testing-with-spock) by Konstantinos Kapelonis

    There should be no other testing framework besides Junit and Mockito? Wrong! Development is about choice and the right tool for the right problem. For this look into a BDD framework from the Groovy universe.  
    - Personally I prefere [Spock framework](http://spockframework.org) over my old friend Junit. But I enjoy going for a drink with both.
