# Revisited 2018 Talk "Agility ≠ Speed" by Kevlin Henney  

I recently watched Kevlin Henney's 2018 conference talks where I had the opportunity to meet him.  
He gave me a much broader view on software development than just delivering code.  

The following ideas are taken from his talk [Agility ≠ Speed - Kevlin Henney - YouTube] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmFcNyZrUNM)  

Let's start with a simple question and see where this might take us.  

```
Why do cars have brakes?  
The simple answer is: to slow down.  
``` 

But isn't agility all about speed and quickness? And about the business value we want to achieve?  

Let's rephrase the question a bit:

```
How fast would you be willing to drive if there were no brakes in the car?
- Stop right now. I would rather walk!
```  

Kevlin's talk takes us to different places, ideas, and thought experiments that will hopefully lead to a better understanding of the way we do things. How we work together.

In the following section, I simply fly from one thought flower to another. Like a bee in a wild flower meadow.

> agile, adjective
> * able to move quickly and easily
>> Oxford English Dirctionary

Adjective -> property of sth. You make an observation of sth. => it's a judgment, you can't do that.  
You can do SCRUM or Kanban. But whether you are more or less agile is an observation you make on something. 
That means you need to observe! There is no such thing as a quick and thorough observation. - you can check or you can observe/study.  

People tend to have a problem with time.

> I made this [letter] longer than usual because I had no time to make it shorter.
>> Blaise Pascal

In my experience, it's the same with writing code. If you don't have time to think and structure it, you get long-winded and hard-to-maintain code.  

In common parlance, velocity and speed are used as the same thing. But they are not!  
Velocity has a direction. When you talk about development velocity, you actually mean speed.  
Direction is actually important. Sometimes it is much better to walk in the right direction than to head at great speed in the wrong one.  

What is the direction? What is it that we actually want to do? How we want to do it? - We want to do it well.  
What are our technical skills? Are our practices good?  
=> These are all directions.

And to understand that as a team, we need to communicate.  

```
Writing code is a learning process, not a production process!
It is codified knowledge. (not my term but I really like it)  
```

It is about written understanding of our business and the technology we use.
Learning is about revisiting, distilling, revising/refactoring.  It takes time.

Knowledge -> learning -> social activity -> communication required.  
Codebase/coding guidelines are a matter of social negotiation.  

So it's about communicating more. - Going to more meetings?  
No, I don't think it is.  It's about finding the right balance.

>> Neil Gaiman (taken from a lecture to people aspiring to a creative career)

We need to start doing, even if it seems small, and talk about it. This will open up ways to understand impact and opportunities for improvement and grow.  

 So let's build, communicate and improve!
